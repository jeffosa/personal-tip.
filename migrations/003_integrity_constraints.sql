-- Migration 003: named integrity constraints and merge reject-predicate parity (v3.1 -> v3.2).
-- Run with: psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f migrations/003_integrity_constraints.sql
-- Lock profile:
--   ADD CONSTRAINT ... NOT VALID  ACCESS EXCLUSIVE, catalog-only, no table scan (milliseconds)
--   VALIDATE CONSTRAINT           SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE: concurrent INSERT/UPDATE continue
--   DROP CONSTRAINT               ACCESS EXCLUSIVE, catalog-only
-- lock_timeout stops an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE request from queueing behind a long transaction and
-- stalling every writer queued behind it. Run outside match-day ingestion windows regardless.
