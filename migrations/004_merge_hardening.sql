-- Migration 004: merge hardening (remediation D1, D2). Upgrades a v3.2 database; a fresh database gets
-- schema.sql only, which already contains this function.
-- Run with: psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f migrations/004_merge_hardening.sql
--
-- D1  Market metrics that are NULL on a player who was on the pitch are rejected to staging_rejects instead
--     of landing as 0 through COALESCE (the SQL backstop for the strict parsing in transform.py).
-- D2  Each call claims at most p_max_batches whole batches (default 200), oldest first, so
--     statement_timeout bounds one round. ConcurrentIngestionEngine.merge_staging loops until a round
--     merges nothing. 200 is a starting value: time a merge on a real server before relying on it.
--
-- Lock profile: DROP FUNCTION and CREATE FUNCTION are catalog-only. A merge already running holds its
-- advisory lock, not a lock on the function, so it finishes with the old body.
-- The zero-argument function must be dropped first: otherwise the new signature becomes an overload and
-- the zero-argument call in pipeline.MERGE_SQL is ambiguous. Never re-apply 002 or 003 after this file.
-- Status: [U] never executed against PostgreSQL.
